# TheListMaker

The List Maker is an app about making lists.
There were a couple of features that I wanted to implement but I didn't know how to. 
I want to put those in future versions of the app.

I have the app pre-load several "lists" but making new ones is easy. 
There are on-screen prompts that will help you, but I think it is quite intuitive. 

--Known Issues--
When you click on the new list icon at the top and you try to return using the back button
before you press a template, it will give you the error "fields cannot be blank". 
A work around for now is to use the cancel button at the top right of the screen.
